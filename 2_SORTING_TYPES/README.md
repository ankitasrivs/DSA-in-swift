> `n` = number of elements,
> `k` = range of input (Counting Sort) or number of digits (Radix Sort)

## 🔁 Bubble Sort

**Idea**: Repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap if they are in the wrong order.
**Best for**: Small arrays or detecting nearly-sorted arrays.

```text
Time: O(n²) worst/avg, O(n) best  
Space: O(1)  
Stable: ✅  
In-place: ✅  
```

---

## 🔄 Selection Sort

**Idea**: Find the minimum element in each pass and move it to the correct position.
**Best for**: Small datasets when memory writes are expensive.

```text
Time: O(n²) in all cases  
Space: O(1)  
Stable: ❌  
In-place: ✅  
```

---

## ➕ Insertion Sort

**Idea**: Build a sorted section of the array by inserting each element into its correct position.
**Best for**: Small or mostly sorted arrays.

```text
Time: O(n²) worst, O(n) best  
Space: O(1)  
Stable: ✅  
In-place: ✅  
```

---

## 🧬 Merge Sort

**Idea**: Divide the array into halves, sort each half recursively, and merge.
**Best for**: Large arrays where stability is needed.

```text
Time: O(n log n)  
Space: O(n)  
Stable: ✅  
In-place: ❌  
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Sort

**Idea**: Choose a pivot, partition the array, and recursively sort the parts.
**Best for**: General-purpose fast sorting.

```text
Time: O(n log n) avg, O(n²) worst  
Space: O(log n)  
Stable: ❌  
In-place: ✅  
```

---

## 📊 Counting Sort

**Idea**: Count the frequency of each value and use cumulative counts to place elements in the correct position.
**Best for**: Sorting integers in a small known range (e.g. \[0, 100]).

```text
Time: O(n + k), where k is the range of input  
Space: O(n + k)  
Stable: ✅  
In-place: ❌  
```

### Example

Input: `[4, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1]`

* Count frequencies → `[0,1,2,2,1,0,0,0,1]`
* Prefix sum → `[0,1,3,5,6,6,6,6,7]`
* Build output from end → `[1,2,2,3,3,4,8]`

## 🧮 Radix Sort

**Idea**: Sort numbers digit by digit starting from the least significant digit, using a stable sorting algorithm like Counting Sort at each digit level.
**Best for**: Sorting large sets of integers or strings when maximum number of digits is small.

```text
Time: O(nk), where k is the number of digits  
Space: O(n + k)  
Stable: ✅  
In-place: ❌  
```
