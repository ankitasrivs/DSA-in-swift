/*
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. Binary heaps are complete binary trees that satisfy the heap property:

Max-Heap: In a max-heap, for any given node i, the value of i is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
Min-Heap: In a min-heap, for any given node i, the value of i is less than or equal to the values of its children.
